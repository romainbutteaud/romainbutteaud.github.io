Hi, I'm Romain.

I'm a software engineer currently interning at Apple until December 2014. I'm graduating from my Masters (University of Technology of Compiegne, France) this January 2015.

I studied Computer Science with a speciality for Data Mining (yes, I'm a data freak), but generally I prefere to consider myself as a full-stack developer who loves to solve challeging problems.

I'm currently looking for a full-time job.

:)

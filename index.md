Hi, I'm Romain.

I'm a software engineer currently interning at Apple until December 2014. I'm graduating from my Masters (University of Technology of Compiegne, France) this January 2015.

Even if I studied Computer Science with an accent on data-mining, I prefere to consider myself as a full-stack developer who loves to solve challeging problems.

:)
